            Let's do some changes here. 
            Non-profit Y is recognized as a top-rated charity in the US. It has been endorsed by many in the industry of
            how efficiently they use their funds and approved by well-known nonprofit evaluation sites like
            givewell.org. In 2020, 85% of their total operating expenses supported programs for children and youth. They
            developed a thorough system of checks and balances to ensure funds are spent in accordance with plans.
            Independent audits of every agency are conducted to ensure transparency. The team from the headquarters of
            the organization regularly and frequently performs detailed reviews of facilities and operations. They also
            visit sponsored children and conduct interviews to ensure they are receiving the benefits and services
            promised to donors and sponsors. In all donation cases, bills and contact information are provided to
            donors, and donors can contact the hospital or other supporting parties to verify the authenticity of the
            fundraising program.

            Non-profit X is a relatively new charity in the US. Most of their work is to help children and youth in
            need. Their charity is currently not listed as a registered organization on the government website. However,
            the team said itâ€™s in the process of being registered on the website. They are seen as a very genuine
            organization.  We do not currently have data on what percent of their operating expenses are spent on
            supporting children.
